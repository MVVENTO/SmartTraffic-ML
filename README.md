# 🚦 Smart Traffic: AI-Powered Traffic Flow Optimization 🌍

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Traffic** project aims to leverage machine learning and reinforcement learning to enhance urban mobility by optimizing traffic flow, reducing congestion, and cutting carbon emissions. Using real-time traffic data and historical patterns, the system predicts traffic conditions and dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings for a more efficient, eco-friendly, and safer transportation system.

By predicting congestion patterns, suggesting eco-friendly routes, and providing data-driven tools for city planners, this project is designed to help build smarter cities and reduce urban pollution.

## 🎯 Objectives

✔️ **Predict** traffic congestion using both historical and real-time data.  
✔️ **Optimize** traffic signal timings through Reinforcement Learning (RL) for real-time adjustments.  
✔️ **Suggest eco-friendly routes** for drivers, minimizing emissions and fuel consumption.  
✔️ **Integrate carbon footprint analytics** to help city planners evaluate the environmental impact of traffic management strategies.
